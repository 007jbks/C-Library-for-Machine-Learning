# C-Library-for-Machine-Learning

**Overview**
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Linear Regression algorithm(others i will implement later on). The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch in C++ and compare its performance and accuracy with popular libraries such as Python's scikit-learn.

The library includes:

Linear Regression Implementation (using Gradient Descent)

Testing Code to evaluate its performance on a simple dataset

You can use this implementation to understand how Linear Regression works, or as a foundation for implementing more complex models and machine learning algorithms in C++.
